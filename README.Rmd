[![Project Status: WIP â€“ Initial development is in progress, but there has not yet been a stable, usable release suitable for the public.](https://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/wip.svg)](https://www.repostatus.org/#wip)

<!-- badges: end -->

**tekton** provides a custom [**pkgdown**](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/) template for [tesselle](https://www.tesselle.org) packages. Please don't use it for your own package.

## Installation

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

```{r gh-installation, eval=FALSE}
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("tesselle/tekton")
```

## Usage

Make sure your `_pkgdown.yaml` contains:

``` yaml
template:
  package: tekton
```

To work properly, `tekton` requires the assets and templates in `inst/pkgdown/assets/`. Because of this, you should not set `default_assets: false` in your `_pkgdown.yaml`.
